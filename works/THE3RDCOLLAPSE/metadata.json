    "description": "This piece contrasts the before and after of still-life decay through photography, merging the frozen-in-time nature of imagery with the inevitable decay of the film itself as a material. It presents a series of images with multiple layers of contrast. Ultimately, it is presented in the form of a double-sided photography book, printed on fragile paper, ensuring that the book gradually deteriorates during its exhibition as viewers flip through its pages.",
