    "description": "In Taiwanese folklore, burning paper items can transmit objects to deceased relatives, allowing them to live eternally together. Origami, beyond its religious functions, strengthens familial bonds and heals sorrow. Conversely, as memory declines, recognizing people becomes harder, and familiar faces may fade away, akin to the 'goldfish brain' phenomenon. This work prints photos of the artist from childhood to adulthood on paper money, compiling them into a photo book. Viewers tear out pages, fold them into fish, and burn them, symbolizing the fading memory of loved ones. The burning fish carry the artist's image to the other side, aiming for eternal remembrance.",
