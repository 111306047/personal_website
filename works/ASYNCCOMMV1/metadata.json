    "description": "This book presents online chat room communication through handmade photography. Unlike face-to-face conversations, online chats often lack continuity, leading to communication breakdowns without facial cues. Created by authors from Taiwan(Yu-Lin Tsai) and Switzerland(Yi-Kai Chen), the book documents a month-long exchange solely through photos. Viewers decide the conversation's pace, achieving a unique asynchronous communication experience.",
