# Eric Tsai's Personal Website 

## Environment
Since the program needs python for auto-content update, please make sure your computer has python installed.

## Content update
1. For content update, please add your work's photos and info into /works as a folder, please refer to the format as mine.
2. After adding the works, run ```python .\metadata_curate.py``` to generate content files for each sub-pages.
3. Finally, updates the file to your github, and deploy the website using github pages.
